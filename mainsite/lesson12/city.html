        <img class="cphoto" src="images/ruins-on-lake.jpg.png" alt="historical photo">
        <p>This 1907 photo shows the once thriving Lake Jackson Plantation standing in ghostly ruin, several years after the infamous Galveston hurricane destroyed much of this inland property. When archeologists began excavations at the main plantation house (left), several smaller structures, and the sugar mill nearly 90 years later, most of the buildings had been reduced to crumbling walls and mounds of rubble.

        <p>Co-Founders Don Wasek and Arch "Beaver" Aplin opened their first store as partners, which is still open as of 2021, in Clute, Texas, in 1982. Aplin formed the name Buc-ee's by combining his childhood nickname; the name of his Labrador Retriever, Buck; as well as the appeal of Ipana toothpaste's animated mascot, Bucky the beaver. Aplin was born in Southeast Texas, with his father originating from, and grandparents residing in, Harrisonburg, Louisiana.</p>
