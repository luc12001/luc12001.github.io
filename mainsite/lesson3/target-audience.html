        <h3>Target Audience</h3>
        <p>We are aiming to be a service for the fashion minded and those who just need help knowing what to wear for the day.</p>
        <p>Persona 1: Someone young and trendy, probably young adult.</p>
        <p>Persona 2: This person will need help deciding what to wear for the day based upon the weather. This could be an undisisive adult, to someone who just wants to be prepared.</p>
        <p>Scenario 1: You wake up in the morning, you remember hearing about rain today, you go check the weather on your favorite site, Weather and You dot com. You hear that it is about 60 degrees out and it will rain. The weather and you then recommends a heavy rain coat, boots, and some thick jeans. Then it adds a scarf based upon the time of year it is. </p>
        <p>Scenario 2: You find yourself always having a hard time deciding what to wear for the day, you often have found that you chose the wrong outfit and are either too hot or too cold. You get an advertisement on your phone for the weather and you dot com. You open it and see the weather for the day being 85 degrees and then see a recommened outfit. You decided to wear this outfit and find it to be great for the day and then continue to use this site.</p>
        <p>Scenario 3: You consider yourself a fashionista, you keep up with trends and styles. Just like everyone else you want to see what the weather will hold for the day. You see it is going to be a nice cool fall day. There is a wind warning for the day. The website the weather and you dot com recommends a hat or large hairband to keep your hair neat, a light coat with a button up shirt, a skirt with soem leggings and boots to compliment the outfit.</p>
        <p>Scenario 4: Often your friends question what you are wearing and why you are wearing it in this weather. You say it's not a phase, but you are tired of it all. You decide to see what the internet recommends and find the weather and you dot com. You see that it gives you a few options for recommened outfits. You find an outfit that fits your style but still works in the area you are in. You order the clothes and get lots of compliments from your friendes.</p>
        <p>Scenario 5: Your friends is coming to you for advice, yet again. You always are helping them find an outfit for the day becuase you always are looking good and feeling fresh. But you would rather spend your time deciding on your own outfit so you tell your friend about the weather and you dot com, they instantly love it and start following it daily to help choose and outfit. </p>
